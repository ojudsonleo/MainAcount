    This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
    interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

    Dynamic objects:

    argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
    path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
    modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

    displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
    excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
      To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
      top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

    stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
    stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
    stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
      By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
      to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

    last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
    last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
    last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
      These three are only available in an interactive session after a
      traceback has been printed.

    Static objects:

    builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
    copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
    exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
    executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
    float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
    float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
    hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
    hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
    implementation -- Python implementation information.
    int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
    maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
    maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
    platform -- platform identifier
    prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
    thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.
    version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
    version_info -- version information as a named tuple
    __stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!
    __stdout__ -- the original stdout; don't touch!
    __stderr__ -- the original stderr; don't touch!
    __displayhook__ -- the original displayhook; don't touch!
    __excepthook__ -- the original excepthook; don't touch!

    Functions:

    displayhook() -- print an object to the screen, and save it in builtins._
    excepthook() -- print an exception and its traceback to sys.stderr
    exc_info() -- return thread-safe information about the current exception
    exit() -- exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit
    getdlopenflags() -- returns flags to be used for dlopen() calls
    getprofile() -- get the global profiling function
    getrefcount() -- return the reference count for an object (plus one :-)
    getrecursionlimit() -- return the max recursion depth for the interpreter
    getsizeof() -- return the size of an object in bytes
    gettrace() -- get the global debug tracing function
    setcheckinterval() -- control how often the interpreter checks for events
    setdlopenflags() -- set the flags to be used for dlopen() calls
    setprofile() -- set the global profiling function
    setrecursionlimit() -- set the max recursion depth for the interpreter
    settrace() -- set the global debug tracing function

            The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the
            given protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
            The default protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and
            is incompatible with previous versions.

            Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest
            protocol version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the
            more recent the version of Python needed to read the pickle
            produced.

            The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a
            single bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for
            binary writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom
            object that meets this interface.

            If *fix_imports* is True and *protocol* is less than 3, pickle
            will try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names
            used in Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable
            with Python 2.

            If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
            serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

            If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
            of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
            (such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
            buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

            The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so
            no proto argument is needed.

            The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that
            takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires
            no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file*
            can be a binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO
            object, or any other custom object that meets this interface.

            The file-like object must have two methods, a read() method
            that takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that
            requires no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.
            Thus file-like object can be a binary file object opened for
            reading, a BytesIO object, or any other custom object that
            meets this interface.

            If *buffers* is not None, it should be an iterable of buffer-enabled
            objects that is consumed each time the pickle stream references
            an out-of-band buffer view.  Such buffers have been given in order
            to the *buffer_callback* of a Pickler object.

            If *buffers* is None (the default), then the buffers are taken
            from the pickle stream, assuming they are serialized there.
            It is an error for *buffers* to be None if the pickle stream
            was produced with a non-None *buffer_callback*.

            Other optional arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and
            *errors*, which are used to control compatibility support for
            pickle stream generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True,
            pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names
            used in Python 3.  The *encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how
            to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these
            default to 'ASCII' and 'strict', respectively. *encoding* can be
            'bytes' to read theses 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.

    This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
    interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

    Dynamic objects:

    argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
    path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
    modules -- dictionary of loaded modules

    displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
    excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
      To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
      top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.

    stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
    stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
    stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
      By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
      to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.

    last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
    last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
    last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
      These three are only available in an interactive session after a
      traceback has been printed.

    Static objects:

    builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
    copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
    exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
    executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
    float_info -- a named tuple with information about the float implementation.
    float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
    hash_info -- a named tuple with information about the hash algorithm.
    hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
    implementation -- Python implementation information.
    int_info -- a named tuple with information about the int implementation.
    maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
    maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
    platform -- platform identifier
    prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
    thread_info -- a named tuple with information about the thread implementation.
    version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
    version_info -- version information as a named tuple
    __stdin__ -- the original stdin; don't touch!
    __stdout__ -- the original stdout; don't touch!
    __stderr__ -- the original stderr; don't touch!
    __displayhook__ -- the original displayhook; don't touch!
    __excepthook__ -- the original excepthook; don't touch!

    Functions:

    displayhook() -- print an object to the screen, and save it in builtins._
    excepthook() -- print an exception and its traceback to sys.stderr
    exc_info() -- return thread-safe information about the current exception
    exit() -- exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit
    getdlopenflags() -- returns flags to be used for dlopen() calls
    getprofile() -- get the global profiling function
    getrefcount() -- return the reference count for an object (plus one :-)
    getrecursionlimit() -- return the max recursion depth for the interpreter
    getsizeof() -- return the size of an object in bytes
    gettrace() -- get the global debug tracing function
    setcheckinterval() -- control how often the interpreter checks for events
    setdlopenflags() -- set the flags to be used for dlopen() calls
    setprofile() -- set the global profiling function
    setrecursionlimit() -- set the max recursion depth for the interpreter
    settrace() -- set the global debug tracing function

    This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.

    There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
    of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
    or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
    The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
    The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).

    The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
    The tuple items are:
      year (including century, e.g. 1998)
      month (1-12)
      day (1-31)
      hours (0-23)

def walk(top, topdown=True, onerror=None, followlinks=False):
    """Directory tree generator.

    For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top
    itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple

        dirpath, dirnames, filenames

    dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of
    the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').
    filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.
    Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.
    To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in
    dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).

    If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
    directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
    (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple
    for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
    subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).

    When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place
    (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the
    subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the
    search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying dirnames when
    topdown is false has no effect on the behavior of os.walk(), since the
    directories in dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames
    itself is generated. No matter the value of topdown, the list of
    subdirectories is retrieved before the tuples for the directory and its
    subdirectories are generated.

    By default errors from the os.scandir() call are ignored.  If
    optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it
    will be called with one argument, an OSError instance.  It can
    report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception
    to abort the walk.  Note that the filename is available as the
    filename attribute of the exception object.

    By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on
    systems that support them.  In order to get this functionality, set the
    optional argument 'followlinks' to true.

    Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the
    current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never
    changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't
    either.

    Example:

    import os
    from os.path import join, getsize
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('python/Lib/email'):
        print(root, "consumes", end="")
        print(sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files), end="")

        This behaves exactly like walk(), except that it yields a 4-tuple

            dirpath, dirnames, filenames, dirfd

        `dirpath`, `dirnames` and `filenames` are identical to walk() output,
        and `dirfd` is a file descriptor referring to the directory `dirpath`.

        The advantage of fwalk() over walk() is that it's safe against symlink
        races (when follow_symlinks is False).

        If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,

    """
    The Python Debugger Pdb
    =======================

    To use the debugger in its simplest form:

            >>> import pdb
            >>> pdb.run('<a statement>')

    The debugger's prompt is '(Pdb) '.  This will stop in the first
    function call in <a statement>.

    Alternatively, if a statement terminated with an unhandled exception,
    you can use pdb's post-mortem facility to inspect the contents of the
    traceback:

            >>> <a statement>
            <exception traceback>
            >>> import pdb
            >>> pdb.pm()

    The commands recognized by the debugger are listed in the next
    section.  Most can be abbreviated as indicated; e.g., h(elp) means
    that 'help' can be typed as 'h' or 'help' (but not as 'he' or 'hel',
    nor as 'H' or 'Help' or 'HELP').  Optional arguments are enclosed in
    square brackets.  Alternatives in the command syntax are separated
    by a vertical bar (|).

    A blank line repeats the previous command literally, except for
    'list', where it lists the next 11 lines.

    Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python
    statements and are executed in the context of the program being
    debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation
    point ('!').  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being
    debugged; it is even possible to change variables or call functions.
    When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is
    printed but the debugger's state is not changed.

    The debugger supports aliases, which can save typing.  And aliases can
    have parameters (see the alias help entry) which allows one a certain
    level of adaptability to the context under examination.

    Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by the
    pair ';;'.  No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the
    input is split at the first ';;', even if it is in the middle of a
    quoted string.

    If a file ".pdbrc" exists in your home directory or in the current
    directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the
    debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for aliases.  If both
    files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases
    defined there can be overridden by the local file.  This behavior can be
    disabled by passing the "readrc=False" argument to the Pdb constructor.

    Aside from aliases, the debugger is not directly programmable; but it
    is implemented as a class from which you can derive your own debugger
    class, which you can make as fancy as you like.

            (Pdb)

            Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number bpnumber.
            The commands themselves are entered on the following lines.
            Type a line containing just 'end' to terminate the commands.
            The commands are executed when the breakpoint is hit.

            To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type commands and
            follow it immediately with end; that is, give no commands.

            With no bpnumber argument, commands refers to the last
            breakpoint set.

            You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up
            again.  Simply use the continue command, or step, or any other
            command that resumes execution.

            Specifying any command resuming execution (currently continue,
            step, next, return, jump, quit and their abbreviations)
            terminates the command list (as if that command was
            immediately followed by end).  This is because any time you
            resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may
            encounter another breakpoint -- which could have its own
            command list, leading to ambiguities about which list to
            execute.

            If you use the 'silent' command in the command list, the usual
            message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This
            may be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific
            message and then continue.  If none of the other commands
            print anything, you will see no sign that the breakpoint was
            reached.
